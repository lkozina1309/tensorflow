# Tensorflow
Deep learning with Tensorflow and python.

## Getting Started

Repository has 2 parts, CNN and RL. Convolutional neural networks (CNN) contains scripts used for computer vision and Reinforcement Learning (RL) uses gym ( https://gym.openai.com/) in order to maximize the notion of cumulative reward.
### Prerequisites

```
Python 3.7–3.9
numpy
scipy
matplotlib
```
### Description

Deep Learning is a part of Machine Learning that focuses on algorithms that are inspired by the structure and function of the human brain. These algorithms are referred to as artificial neural networks. Neural networks learn to do things by considering examples, which is what we as humans do. Deep learning is behind a lot of the new cool technologies like driverless cars.TensorFlow is an open-source software library created by Google for numerical computation using data flow graphs. 

CNN is a process of transforming original data into a feature map by applying an operation of convolution. Mathematically speaking, convolution is an operation on two functions that produces a third function. That third function shows how the shape of one is modified by the other. Technically, the convolution performs a pixel-wise multiplication of the filter with the portion of the image and then sums up the result. Then, the filter is moved to the next portion of the image so this operation repeats. Intuitively, every subsequent convolution layer in the CNN is a simpler version of the previous layer. In this process, we (ideally) get reduced data without losing any important features present in the original data.

Reinforcement learning provides the capacity for us not only to teach an artificial agent how to act, but to allow it to learn through it’s own interactions with an environment. By combining the complex representations that deep neural networks can learn with the goal-driven learning of an RL agent, computers have accomplished some amazing feats.
