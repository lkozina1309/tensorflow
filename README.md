# Tensorflow
Deep learning with Tensorflow and python.

## Getting Started

Repository has 2 parts, CNN and RL. Convolutional neural networks (CNN) contains scripts used for computer vision and Reinforcement Learning (RL) uses gym ( https://gym.openai.com/) in order to maximize the notion of cumulative reward.
### Prerequisites

```
Python 3.7â€“3.9
numpy
scipy
matplotlib
```
