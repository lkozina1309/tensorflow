### Description

TensorFlow is a free and open-source software library for machine learning and artificial intelligence. Deep learning (also known as deep structured learning) is part of a broader family of machine learning methods based on artificial neural networks with representation learning. Learning can be supervised, semi-supervised or unsupervised.

Repository has 2 parts, CNN and RL. Convolutional neural networks (CNN) contains scripts used for computer vision and Reinforcement Learning (RL) uses gym ( https://gym.openai.com/) in order to maximize the notion of cumulative reward.

Repository CNN has scripts used for classification of images. These scripts can be used in more serious projects.
